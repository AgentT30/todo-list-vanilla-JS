# This project is developed using HTML, CSS and JS.

## This is a demonstration of the basic features of vanilla JavaScript. This includes getting elements from the DOM, setting elements on the DOM without refreshing the page etc.

This project works well on large desktop screens to small mobile devices. The page is fully responsive.

### Future Plans:

The project does not have persistant data storage, meaning upon refreshing the page, all the data is lost and is reset. This can be overcome by using a database at the backend to store the items permanently.
